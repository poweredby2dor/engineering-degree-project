The main project target is to create an automated system. Using my experience gathered from my time at the Unilever Ploiesti factory, where powder detergents are made by mixing prime ingredients to create a paste that it's transformed into powder through an atomizer.

The project consists of a mixing container, three dosing sistems for two liquid and one solid ingredient, discharge system, power supplies, compressed air supplies and a central controlling unit. The central controlling unit consists of an Arduino Mega board connected to all the automation components, various sensors and panel with buttons for controlling the project.
